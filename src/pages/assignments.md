The assignment due dates and times are shown in the course [Schedule](/schedule/) page.

The penalties for late submission are shown in the course [Policies](/policies/) page.

You may work with one teammate on each assignment, and we prefer that you do so. If you do work with a teammate on an assignment, then we will expect you to work with that same teammate on all assignments. You may switch teammates only with the approval of the course's lead instructor.
