# Hello, Course Websites!

> Just a block quote. This is a really run on sentence to show that a block quote will continue onto the next line if the available width is narrow enough otherwise it will stay on the same line of the page if it is able to.

## Text

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## Code

Here is an example of `inline code`

Here is a code block:

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
